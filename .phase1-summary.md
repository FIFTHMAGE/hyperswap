# Phase 1 Complete: Foundation & Core Refactoring (50 Commits)

## Summary

Successfully restructured the codebase with industry-standard feature-based architecture.

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Created core module structure (`src/core/`)
- ✅ Established infrastructure layer (`src/infrastructure/`)
- ✅ Built comprehensive shared module (`src/shared/`)
- ✅ Moved 60+ UI components to shared
- ✅ Consolidated utility functions
- ✅ Set up feature module directories
- ✅ Implemented barrel exports

## Architecture Changes

```
src/
├── core/              # Core configuration & contexts
├── infrastructure/    # External services (API, storage, cache)
├── shared/           # Reusable components, utils, types
└── features/         # Feature modules (swap, liquidity, etc.)
```

## Next: Phase 2 - Feature Module Reorganization
